Have you thought about what happens in the event of your death? While you hope that you don't have to worry about such a thing, it's always best to plan for the inevitable. With the help of us at KLM Insurance Solutions Inc., we can be sure that you have reliable life insurance in Pennsylvania.

## Types of Life Insurance

Did you know that there are different types of life insurance? Shopping for a policy on your own can be overwhelming. How much coverage do you need? Should you choose term or whole?

Term life insurance is purchased so that you can have coverage for a set period. It allows you to set a specific term for the life insurance to be valid, ranging between five and 30 years. If you outline the term, the policy becomes invalid.

The other option is whole life insurance. While it is more expensive, it also provides you with coverage for your entire life. There is also a cash value tied to the policy, allowing you to use it as a retirement planning tool.

As for what type of policy works best for you depends on your current situation and your budget.

## How to Find the Right Policy

There are a lot of things that go into a life insurance policy. Working with an independent insurance agent can help to answer some of your questions and ensure that you have the kind of coverage that you need.

Knowing how much coverage is usually dependent on a few different things, including:

- Funeral expenses
- Income source
- Tuition for school-age children
- Debts
- Living standards

When you are in your life can help to determine what kind of coverage you need. This is especially true if you have children. More coverage may be necessary.
