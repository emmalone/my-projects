## Data Quality Notes

### High Confidence Areas:
- Building addresses and locations
- Year built
- Construction type
- Unit counts
- Building update years (all systems 2024)
- Fire safety equipment presence
- Occupancy type and percentages
- Tenant screening procedures
- Property management structure
- Loss history (clean record)

### Areas Requiring Verification:
- Square footage for Property 2 (4,000 - appears lower, may need verification)
- HVAC year for Property 2 (2021 in Penn-America vs. 2024 in Millers - discrepancy)
- Some checkbox markings in handwritten form may be ambiguous

### Missing Information:
- **Building values/replacement costs** (not captured in this form set)
- **Coverage limits** (not captured)
- **Premium amounts** (not captured)
- **Deductibles** (not captured)

---

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Verify Building Values:**
   - Need to obtain building values and replacement costs for both properties
   - Check other documents (quote, policy declarations) for this data

2. **Resolve Discrepancy:**
   - Confirm HVAC year for Property 2 (2021 or 2024?)
   - Verify square footage for Property 2

3. **Use This Data:**
   - Import all extracted data into database for future application use
   - Reference this for completing ACORD 125, 140, and Miller Supplemental forms
   - Use as historical reference for underwriting questions

4. **Risk Mitigation Recommendations:**
   - Consider sprinkler system for Property 1 (30 units, no sprinklers)
   - Continue regular maintenance and inspections
   - Maintain certificates of insurance for all contractors
