What is a Buy/Sell Agreement?

A buy/sell agreement is a legally binding contract among owners that sets the terms for how ownership transfers when a trigger event occurs (death, disability, retirement, divorce, or voluntary exit). Insurance is the most reliable way to fund that agreement so cash is available the moment it’s needed.

Why it matters

Keeps the business in the family (or with remaining partners), not with a spouse/estate

Provides cash at the worst possible time, avoiding fire-sale financing

Removes disputes by setting valuation and process in advance

Satisfies lender or investor requirements for continuity planning

Agreement structures

Cross-Purchase: Each owner buys a policy on the others; clean basis step-up, more policies as owner count grows

Entity Redemption: The company buys the policies and redeems the departing owner’s shares; simpler administration

Wait-and-See / Hybrid: Lets you decide between cross-purchase and redemption at trigger time

Funding options

Term life for cost-efficient protection aligned to a time horizon (10-30 years)

Permanent life (WL/IUL/GUL) when long-term or multi-trigger funding is desired

Disability buy-out for non-death events that prevent an owner from working

Optional cash value can provide flexibility for future recapitalization

Coverage amounts & valuation

Tie the face amount to the agreement’s valuation formula (fixed, multiple of earnings, independent appraisal, or book value)

Revisit coverage as valuation changes (annual review)

Consider tax and basis effects; we can coordinate with your CPA and attorney

What to expect in underwriting

Abbreviated application with financial justification

Medical history / labs may be required at higher limits or ages

Ownership/consent documentation (and disability questionnaires if included)

Typical timelines: 1–3 weeks for term with accelerated programs, longer for permanent or large cases
