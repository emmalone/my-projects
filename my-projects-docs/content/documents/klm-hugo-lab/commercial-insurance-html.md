# Commercial Insurance

Have you thought about whether you have sufficient insurance in place for your business in Pennsylvania? All it takes is one accident to lose everything. At KLM Insurance Solutions Inc., we can make sure that you have the commercial insurance that you need.

### Types of Commercial Insurance

Your business needs to be protected against everything that could happen. As such, your business may need different insurance policies than another business in Pennsylvania.

Some of the most common policies include:

* Liability
* Property
* Auto
* Business interruption
* Umbrella

Even if your business is based in the home, you will still need to consider commercial insurance. You might be surprised by what home insurance wonât cover. You need to think about every asset that you own, from inventory to company vehicles. With the right coverage, you can make sure you have the protection you need.

If something happens, it is easier to file a claim than to risk your business going bankrupt. With the help of our agents, weâll build the comprehensive policies that you can depend on.

### Updating Your Policy

Just as commercial insurance is not one-size-fits-all, itâs also not capable of providing you with protection as your business evolves. Our independent insurance agents can work with you on an annual basis to make updates to your policy. This includes adding coverage as you grow your business as well as adjusting the coverage levels. In the event that something does happen, keeping your policy updated will ensure that insurance takes care of everything.

Weâll make sure that youâre compliant with all of the business insurance requirements for the state and your industry. Plus, weâll actively work to find you affordable premiums. This way, you can ensure your business is always covered and always saving.
