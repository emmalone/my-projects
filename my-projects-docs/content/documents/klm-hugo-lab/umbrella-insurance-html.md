# Umbrella Insurance

You never know what could happen or how expensive it will be to recover. Although you may have plenty of insurance in place in Pennsylvania, you can never have enough. Umbrella insurance can be just what you need to prevent financial ruin. At KLM Insurance Solutions Inc., weâll help you discover how helpful it can be.

### How Umbrella Insurance is Used

Throughout Pennsylvania, you need to be covered for all that could happen. What happens when the insurance you have isnât enough? It doesnât take much to exhaust the coverage limits when thereâs a major accident. Once coverage levels are exceeded, the remaining costs are yours to shoulder.

With an umbrella policy, it works to add more coverage to a policy. It covers all your existing residential (or commercial) policies to include:

* Auto
* Home
* Renter's
* Condo
* RV
* Boat

When you have an umbrella policy, itâs there when you need it. While you hope itâs never used, it can be the saving grace you need to protect you from bankruptcy after a major accident.

### Finding Umbrella Insurance in Pennsylvania

There are all sorts of different umbrella policies available to you across the state. How much coverage do you want to add? Which company offers the best policies? What is an affordable premium?
