## New Product Vision
### 1. Digital life & legacy vault
A secure portal where clients and their families store key documents, instructions, and wishes alongside their policies. This can bundle multiple planning needs into one recurring product.[seasonshospice +1]
•	Features: Document storage (policies, wills, passwords), contact list of advisors, funeral preferences, letter-to-family, and secure sharing rules similar to tools like Everplans.[care +1]
•	Why clients pay: Peace of mind that “everything is in one place” and family will know what to do if something happens.[care]

### 2. End-of-life preferences & advance directive builder
A guided questionnaire that turns values and preferences into structured medical directives and care instructions. This complements life insurance by addressing “how” care should look, not just “who gets money.”[crossroadshospice +1]
•	Features: Step-by-step questionnaire (like Cake-style preference flows), exportable advance directive forms, state-specific templates, and sharing to family and doctors.[seasonshospice +1]
•	Why clients pay: Avoids family conflict and ensures medical teams follow clearly expressed wishes.[crossroadshospice]
### 3. Beneficiary & policy review assistant
Many people never update beneficiaries after life events, which causes major issues at claim time. A recurring-review tool gives you a structured reason to meet and charge for ongoing planning.[rightcapital]
•	Features: Annual “beneficiary checkup” workflow, alerts after key life events, side-by-side view of policies, ownership, and contingent beneficiaries.[rightcapital]
•	Why clients pay: Reduces risk of ex-spouses, outdated trusts, or minor children being improperly listed.

### 4. Estate planning readiness checklist
A planning dashboard that shows which estate documents a client has and what is missing. It does not have to replace an attorney; it can coordinate the process.[relaw +1]
•	Features: Checklist across will, trust, POA, healthcare proxy, guardianship, with education and referrals to attorneys or AI-based document tools.[octalsoftware +1]
•	Why clients pay: Turns an overwhelming legal topic into clear next steps and progress tracking.
### 5. Survivorship playbook for the family
A “when I die, do this” interactive guide aimed at the surviving spouse or children. Selling this at policy issue time creates long-term stickiness.[seasonshospice +1]
•	Features: Task list (who to call, where accounts are, how to claim benefits), timelines, contact directory, and checklists that can be updated over time.[care]
•	Why clients pay: Loved ones can navigate the first 90 days after death with less stress and fewer missed benefits.

### 6. Subscription-based legacy message service
A structured way for clients to record letters, videos, or milestone messages for their heirs. This is emotional but highly valued and ties naturally to life insurance conversations.[seasonshospice]
•	Features: Time-locked messages, event-triggered messages (e.g., child’s graduation), guidance prompts, and secure storage linked to the digital vault.[seasonshospice]
•	Why clients pay: Helps clients “be present” for future milestones even if they are gone.
### 7. End-of-life financial organizing hub
A hub that pulls in high-level info about accounts, debts, and key assets so heirs can settle affairs more easily. This is not full financial planning, but an overview designed for survivorship.[rightcapital +1]
•	Features: Asset and liability inventory, institution contact info, location of account documents, and notes on how each item should be handled.[rightcapital +1]
•	Why clients pay: Reduces the time and cost of estate administration and avoids overlooked accounts.
### 8. Caregiver and eldercare coordination tool
Many life insurance buyers also care for aging parents. A tool that organizes caregiving logistics becomes a powerful cross-sell.[care]
•	Features: Care calendar, medication and provider lists, shared notes among family caregivers, and storage of elder’s directives and insurance.[care]
•	Why clients pay: Coordinates family members, reduces burnout, and ensures everyone follows the same plan.


### 9. Funeral and memorial planning workspace
A dedicated module where clients can plan the type of service they want, budget, and preferred vendors. You can pair this with final expense or life policies.[seasonshospice]
•	Features: Preference capture (burial vs cremation, music, readings), cost estimates, vendor contact storage, and checklists for the family.[seasonshospice]
•	Why clients pay: Families avoid guesswork and conflict during a highly emotional time.
### 10. Compliance-friendly client portal for agents
From your side, a white-labeled portal that bundles these tools lets you offer a holistic “life & legacy plan” instead of just a policy. This can be sold as a subscription add-on per household.[asnoa +1]
•	Features: Secure messaging, document e-sign, reminders, annual review scheduling, and integration with your CRM/AMS.[peoplekeep +1]
•	Why clients pay: Ongoing access to planning tools and the confidence that everything is updated and monitored, not a one-time transaction.
If you share your typical client profile (age band, income, products you sell today, and whether you’re fully independent or captive), a concrete SaaS bundle and pricing model can be drafted around 3–4 of these tools that best fit your b

# Roll out
## Phase 1: Design the platform and launch v1

Focus: build the core client portal plus 1–2 flagship modules (digital vault + survivorship playbook) and validate that agents and households will pay.[3][1]

- Define ICP and promise  
  - Start with independent life agents serving mass-affluent families (e.g., ages 35–70, $100k–$500k income) who value planning but lack organization.[3]
  - Position as “life & legacy planning workspace” that agents bundle with policies to differentiate and justify annual reviews.  

- Choose initial feature set  
  - Platform layer: secure login, household profiles, basic document storage, sharing with family, and a lightweight client dashboard similar to modern insurance portals.[1][3]
  - First paid modules to build:  
    - Digital life & legacy vault (documents, contacts, basic wishes).  
    - Survivorship playbook (checklists and tasks for heirs after death).  

- Build a lean v1  
  - Use pragmatic tech choices (e.g., one web app, simple RBAC, encrypted storage, audit logs) and avoid deep carrier integrations at the start.[3]
  - Aim for 8–12 weeks to a usable pilot; shipping quickly matters more than covering every edge case.[2]

- Run a controlled pilot  
  - Recruit 5–10 friendly agents; give them free access for 3–6 months in exchange for using it with at least 20 households each.[2]
  - Measure: % of clients who activate accounts, # of documents stored, # of shared family logins, and whether agents feel it helps with retention and referrals.[4]

## Phase 2: Add modules one by one

Once the base portal works, layer the remaining tools as separate modules that can be turned on per household or per agent plan.[1][3]

- Module 3: Beneficiary & policy review assistant  
  - Build workflows to capture policies, beneficiaries, and event-triggered reminders; start with manual entry, then later add OCR/import.[5][3]
  - Outcome: gives agents a structured reason to schedule annual reviews and upsells, which directly ties to ARR for them and for you.  

- Module 4: Advance directive & end-of-life preferences builder  
  - Add guided questionnaires and state-specific templates by partnering with existing directive/estate providers or licensed content sources.[6][7]
  - Outcome: increases emotional value for clients and makes the platform more “must-have” for families.  

- Module 5: Estate readiness checklist + financial organizing hub  
  - Implement a simple checklist and asset inventory (accounts, properties, debts) with clear “done/not done” status.[7][5]
  - Outcome: prepares upsell paths to attorneys, financial advisors, or more advanced planning; enhances stickiness.  

- Module 6: Funeral and memorial planning + legacy messages  
  - Build preference capture and time-locked messages last, as these are highly emotional but not strictly required for the platform to be useful.[8]
  - Outcome: deepens engagement from households already on the platform, improving retention more than acquisition.  

- Module 7: Caregiver and eldercare coordination  
  - Position as an add-on for clients with aging parents; reuse your core: contacts, calendars, documents, and checklists.[6]
  - Outcome: opens a second category of use (eldercare) under the same subscription, boosting perceived value.

## Phase 3: Packaging, pricing, and ARR engine

Design pricing to be simple for agents, but allow expansion via households and modules.[9][2]

- Choose a primary monetization model  
  - Agent-centric: charge agents per active household (e.g., bundles of 50/200/500 households) with all modules included at higher tiers.[1][3]
  - Hybrid: base fee per agent/user plus usage tiers by number of households or premium modules like caregiver coordination.  

- Anchor on clear value drivers  
  - Help agents use your platform to:  
    - Increase policy persistency and renewals by staying top-of-mind with clients via annual reviews.[10][3]
    - Win new business with a differentiated “life & legacy platform” rather than just quoting cheaper premiums.  

- Land-and-expand motions  
  - Land: start with a “core platform + vault + survivorship playbook” bundle as a simple, single price for small agencies.[11][2]
  - Expand: upsell additional modules (beneficiary assistant, caregiver tools) via in-app prompts and agent education once clients are using basics.[4][11]

## Phase 4: Go-to-market playbook

You are selling B2B2C: to agents (paid) and their households (end users). Build GTM around agents first.[2][3]

- Pre-launch and early launch  
  - Interview at least 30 agents and agency owners about their review process, tech stack, and retention issues.[2]
  - Create simple sales collateral: a 1-page overview, 2–3 demo videos, and agent talking points for presenting the portal to clients.[12][2]

- Distribution channels  
  - Direct outreach: email + LinkedIn to independent agents, focusing first on your region and niche (e.g., independent life/wealth hybrids).[2]
  - Leverage aggregators: approach FMOs/IMOs, clusters, or networks that can offer your portal as an agent benefit, possibly white-labeled.[10][3]
  - Content: publish “how to run a high-value annual review” and “how to retain multigenerational clients” playbooks that showcase your platform.[12][4]

- Product-led elements  
  - Offer a free sandbox for agents with 5–10 households to experience the platform before paying.[11][4]
  - Use in-app guidance and templates that make it easy for agents to invite clients and run their first review within a week.  

## Phase 5: Metrics and iteration

Track metrics that connect directly to ARR and agent success rather than vanity metrics.[9]

- Core product metrics  
  - Agent-side: # of paying agencies, # of agents per agency, and ARPA (average revenue per account).[9]
  - Household-side: % of clients activated, docs stored per household, checklists completed, and recurring logins.  

- Revenue and retention  
  - ARR = (# paying agencies × average annual contract value) + any household add-ons.[9]
  - Watch logo churn (agents leaving) and “seat churn” (agents inside agencies not using it) and interview churned users to fix onboarding gaps.[4]

- Roadmap discipline  
  - Use a public or semi-public roadmap to show upcoming modules, but avoid promising dates early; prioritize features that drive activation and retention.[13][2]
  - Decide module order based on data: build next what existing agents ask for and what correlates with higher household engagement.  

If you share whether you plan to bootstrap or raise capital and your own technical/industry experience, a more concrete 6–12 month roadmap (with timelines and team roles) can be laid out around this sequence.
