**Presentation:**
"In addition to the policy, we offer a planning platform that helps your family know what to do when something happens. Can I show you a quick demo?"

**Demo Points (5 minutes):**
1. Document vault (peace of mind, everything in one place)
2. Survivorship playbook (family won't forget critical steps)
3. Emergency access (available when needed)
4. Annual review integration (keep it updated)

**Pricing Introduction:**
"It's $9.99/month, which is like adding $120/year to protect a policy worth hundreds of thousands. Most clients see it as essential peace of mind."
