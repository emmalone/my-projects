"Your life insurance pays money, but who tells your family what to do with it? We do."

No direct competitors bundle this with life insurance. Most estate planning tools stop at the legal documents.

## Agent Training

Agents need talking points:
- "This ensures your family knows exactly what to do"
- "You're not just leaving money, you're leaving instructions"
- "This is like leaving a roadmap when your family needs it most"
- "It takes 20 minutes to set up, but saves your family weeks of stress"
