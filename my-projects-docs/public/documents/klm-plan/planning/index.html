Digital life & legacy vault<a class=anchor href=#1-digital-life--legacy-vault>#</a></h3><p>A secure portal where clients and their families store key documents, instructions, and wishes alongside their policies. This can bundle multiple planning needs into one recurring product.[seasonshospice +1]
• Features: Document storage (policies, wills, passwords), contact list of advisors, funeral preferences, letter-to-family, and secure sharing rules similar to tools like Everplans.[care +1]
• Why clients pay: Peace of mind that “everything is in one place” and family will know what to do if something happens.[care]</p><h3 id=2-end-of-life-preferences--advance-directive-builder>2. End-of-life preferences & advance directive builder<a class=anchor href=#2-end-of-life-preferences--advance-directive-builder>#</a></h3><p>A guided questionnaire that turns values and preferences into structured medical directives and care instructions. This complements life insurance by addressing “how” care should look, not just “who gets money.”[crossroadshospice +1]
• Features: Step-by-step questionnaire (like Cake-style preference flows), exportable advance directive forms, state-specific templates, and sharing to family and doctors.[seasonshospice +1]
• Why clients pay: Avoids family conflict and ensures medical teams follow clearly expressed wishes.[crossroadshospice]</p><h3 id=3-beneficiary--policy-review-assistant>3. Beneficiary & policy review assistant<a class=anchor href=#3-beneficiary--policy-review-assistant>#</a></h3><p>Many people never update beneficiaries after life events, which causes major issues at claim time. A recurring-review tool gives you a structured reason to meet and charge for ongoing planning.[rightcapital]
• Features: Annual “beneficiary checkup” workflow, alerts after key life events, side-by-side view of policies, ownership, and contingent beneficiaries.[rightcapital]
• Why clients pay: Reduces risk of ex-spouses, outdated trusts, or minor children being improperly listed.</p><h3 id=4-estate-planning-readiness-checklist>4. Estate planning readiness checklist<a class=anchor href=#4-estate-planning-readiness-checklist>#</a></h3><p>A planning dashboard that shows which estate documents a client has and what is missing. It does not have to replace an attorney; it can coordinate the process.[relaw +1]
• Features: Checklist across will, trust, POA, healthcare proxy, guardianship, with education and referrals to attorneys or AI-based document tools.[octalsoftware +1]
• Why clients pay: Turns an overwhelming legal topic into clear next steps and progress tracking.</p><h3 id=5-survivorship-playbook-for-the-family>5. Survivorship playbook for the family<a class=anchor href=#5-survivorship-playbook-for-the-family>#</a></h3><p>A “when I die, do this” interactive guide aimed at the surviving spouse or children. Selling this at policy issue time creates long-term stickiness.[seasonshospice +1]
• Features: Task list (who to call, where accounts are, how to claim benefits), timelines, contact directory, and checklists that can be updated over time.[care]
• Why clients pay: Loved ones can navigate the first 90 days after death with less stress and fewer missed benefits.</p><h3 id=6-subscription-based-legacy-message-service>6. Subscription-based legacy message service<a class=anchor href=#6-subscription-based-legacy-message-service>#</a></h3><p>A structured way for clients to record letters, videos, or milestone messages for their heirs. This is emotional but highly valued and ties naturally to life insurance conversations.[seasonshospice]
• Features: Time-locked messages, event-triggered messages (e.g., child’s graduation), guidance prompts, and secure storage linked to the digital vault.[seasonshospice]
• Why clients pay: Helps clients “be present” for future milestones even if they are gone.</p><h3 id=7-end-of-life-financial-organizing-hub>7. End-of-life financial organizing hub<a class=anchor href=#7-end-of-life-financial-organizing-hub>#</a></h3><p>A hub that pulls in high-level info about accounts, debts, and key assets so heirs can settle affairs more easily. This is not full financial planning, but an overview designed for survivorship.[rightcapital +1]
• Features: Asset and liability inventory, institution contact info, location of account documents, and notes on how each item should be handled.[rightcapital +1]
• Why clients pay: Reduces the time and cost of estate administration and avoids overlooked accounts.</p><h3 id=8-caregiver-and-eldercare-coordination-tool>8. Caregiver and eldercare coordination tool<a class=anchor href=#8-caregiver-and-eldercare-coordination-tool>#</a></h3><p>Many life insurance buyers also care for aging parents. A tool that organizes caregiving logistics becomes a powerful cross-sell.[care]
• Features: Care calendar, medication and provider lists, shared notes among family caregivers, and storage of elder’s directives and insurance.[care]
• Why clients pay: Coordinates family members, reduces burnout, and ensures everyone follows the same plan.</p><h3 id=9-funeral-and-memorial-planning-workspace>9. Funeral and memorial planning workspace<a class=anchor href=#9-funeral-and-memorial-planning-workspace>#</a></h3><p>A dedicated module where clients can plan the type of service they want, budget, and preferred vendors. You can pair this with final expense or life policies.[seasonshospice]
• Features: Preference capture (burial vs cremation, music, readings), cost estimates, vendor contact storage, and checklists for the family.[seasonshospice]
• Why clients pay: Families avoid guesswork and conflict during a highly emotional time.</p><h3 id=10-compliance-friendly-client-portal-for-agents>10. Compliance-friendly client portal for agents<a class=anchor href=#10-compliance-friendly-client-portal-for-agents>#</a></h3><p>From your side, a white-labeled portal that bundles these tools lets you offer a holistic “life & legacy plan” instead of just a policy. This can be sold as a subscription add-on per household.[asnoa +1]
• Features: Secure messaging, document e-sign, reminders, annual review scheduling, and integration with your CRM/AMS.[peoplekeep +1]
• Why clients pay: Ongoing access to planning tools and the confidence that everything is updated and monitored, not a one-time transaction.

shipping quickly matters more than covering every edge case.[2]</li></ul></li><li><p>Run a controlled pilot</p><ul><li>Recruit 5–10 friendly agents; give them free access for 3–6 months in exchange for using it with at least 20 households each.[2]</li><li>Measure: % of clients who activate accounts, # of documents stored, # of shared family logins, and whether agents feel it helps with retention and referrals.[4]</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=phase-2-add-modules-one-by-one>Phase 2: Add modules one by one<a class=anchor href=#phase-2-add-modules-one-by-one>#</a></h2><p>Once the base portal works, layer the remaining tools as separate modules that can be turned on per household or per agent plan.[1][3]</p><ul><li><p>Module 3: Beneficiary & policy review assistant</p><ul><li>Build workflows to capture policies, beneficiaries, and event-triggered reminders;

enhances stickiness.</li></ul></li><li><p>Module 6: Funeral and memorial planning + legacy messages</p><ul><li>Build preference capture and time-locked messages last, as these are highly emotional but not strictly required for the platform to be useful.[8]</li><li>Outcome: deepens engagement from households already on the platform, improving retention more than acquisition.</li></ul></li><li><p>Module 7: Caregiver and eldercare coordination</p><ul><li>Position as an add-on for clients with aging parents;
